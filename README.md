# WIGGLE 0.2.1 (alpha)
Graphical user interface to integrate cryo-EM flexibility analyses with ChimeraX.

## What is WIGGLE?
Wiggle is a software package that integrates within [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) to perform conformational flexibility analysis. Wiggle facilitates more interactive, intuitive, and rapid analysis of cryo-EM flexibility data types. Wiggle provides a tool to structural biologists to seemlessly visualise [cryoDRGN](http://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/cryodrgn/) or [cryoSPARC](https://cryosparc.com/) [3D variability](https://guide.cryosparc.com/processing-data/tutorials-and-case-studies/tutorial-3d-variability-analysis-part-one) results while simultaneously visualising 3D volumetric data. The goal is to facilitate the sharing, deposition, analysis, and interpretation of next generation cryo-EM data types. Wiggle provides several key tools to achieve these goals:
* Integrated into UCSF ChimeraX (easy install).
* Read and write a single file format (compressed numpy array, .npz). 
* Facilitates the sharing and deposition of structural dynamics data. 
* Perform complex tasks with a GUI and interact with the variability landscape.
* Rapid volume rendering to enable near realtime feedback.
* Import and export cryoSPARC data file times to enable further analysis.
